##Investigating mechanisms for all-optical switching in magnetoelectric heterostructures

Exploring the frontiers of computing beyond traditional CMOS has been a focal point in both device development and fundamental physics research [1,2]. A notable advancement is Intel's Magnetoelectric Spin Orbit (MESO) device, a synergy of magnetoelectrics and spintronics, targeting attojoule-class logic gates for computing. This innovation aims to sustain Mooreâ€™s Law through transistor scaling [1,2].
However, persistent challenges exist, particularly concerning the need for an electric field close to the breakdown voltage to operate these devices. Researchers like Huang et al. [3] highlighted the necessity of high voltage in achieving polarization even in composite multiferroic materials like BiFeO3, a frontrunner for low-power spintronics and emerging memory technologies. Similarly, Chen et al. demonstrated the dependence of non-volatile electric field manipulation of magnetoresistance (MR) in an MTJ stack on applying an electric field near the breakdown voltage of the PMN-PT piezoelectric substrate [4].
Manipatruni et al.'s insightful publication in Nature Physics delves into additional challenges in combined spintronic-magnetoelectric systems. Beyond the large electric field requirement, questions arise regarding transducing a spintronic/multiferroic state to a photonic state (and vice versa) for extensive interconnects and how to harness extreme scaling [5].
For heightened data storage density, the integration of multiple physical quantities (optical, electrical, and magnetic) into a single device, known as multilevel memory, emerges as an effective approach for both conventional and neuromorphic computing, exemplified by Wang et al.'s work [6].
In our pursuit, we emphasize the significance of light-induced magnetization modulation in magnetoelectric heterostructures. Beyond replacing voltage sources, a critical element for extreme scaling, this approach introduces a multilevel switching aspect, offering promising avenues for advancing memory technologies and pushing the boundaries of beyond-CMOS applications.
