<h2 style="font-size:24px;"> Investigating mechanism for all-optical switching in magnetoelectric heterostructures<h2>

<p style="font-size:16px;"> Exploring the frontiers of computing beyond traditional CMOS has been a focal point in both device development and fundamental physics research. A notable advancement is Intel's recent Magnetoelectric Spin Orbit (MESO) device, a synergy of magnetoelectrics and spintronics, targeting attojoule-class logic gates for computing. This innovation aims to sustain Mooreâ€™s Law through transistor scaling.

However, persistent challenges exist, particularly concerning the need for an electric field close to the breakdown voltage to operate these devices. Beyond the large electric field requirement, challenges also arise regarding transducing a spintronic/multiferroic state to a photonic state (and vice versa) for extensive interconnects and to harness extreme scaling.

For this, the integration of multiple physical quantities (optical, electrical, and magnetic) into a single device, known as multilevel memory, emerges as an effective approach for both conventional and neuromorphic computing.

For this my research emphasizes the significance of optically-induced magnetization modulation in magnetoelectric heterostructures. This technique beyond replacing voltage sources, a critical element for extreme scaling, also introduces a multilevel switching aspect, offering promising avenues for advancing memory technologies and pushing the boundaries of beyond-CMOS applications.<p>
