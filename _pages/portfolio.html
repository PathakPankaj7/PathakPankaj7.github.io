Exploring the frontiers of computing beyond traditional CMOS has been a focal point in both device development and fundamental physics research. A notable advancement is Intel's recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto-electric_spin-orbit" target="_blank" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;">Magnetoelectric Spin Orbit (MESO)</a> device, a synergy of magnetoelectrics and spintronics, targeting attojoule-class logic gates for computing. This innovation aims to sustain Mooreâ€™s Law through transistor scaling. However, persistent challenges exist, particularly concerning the need for an electric field close to the breakdown voltage to operate these devices. Beyond the large electric field requirement, challenges also arise regarding transducing a spintronic/multiferroic state to a photonic state (and vice versa) for extensive interconnects and to harness extreme scaling. For this, the integration of multiple physical quantities (optical, electrical, and magnetic) into a single device, known as multilevel memory, emerges as an effective approach for both conventional and neuromorphic computing. For this, my research emphasizes the significance of optically-induced magnetization modulation in magnetoelectric heterostructures. This technique beyond replacing voltage sources, a critical element for extreme scaling, also introduces a multilevel switching aspect, offering promising avenues for advancing memory technologies and pushing the boundaries of beyond-CMOS applications.

Although the exploration of electric field control of magnetism has garnered attention due to its potential applications in memory, computing, and RF technologies, a notable gap exists in the literature regarding its utilization in the biomedical field. In my research, I am also exploring the intricate mechanisms of magnetoelectric devices, with a specific focus on developing compact magnetoelectric-based lab-on-a-chip devices. With this innovative approach, we are not only trying to circumvent the need for cumbersome electromagnets for precise magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) control but also exploring an energy-efficient route for quantitatively assessing the trapped MNPs for advancing the therapeutic efficacy of current magnetoelectric-based lab-on-a-chip systems. This breakthrough has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency of various biomedical applications, offering a novel and sophisticated solution that transcends the limitations of conventional methodologies.
