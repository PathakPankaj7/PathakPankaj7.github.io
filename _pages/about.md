Thank you for visiting. I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Cavendish Laboratory](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. My research is primarly focused on spintronics and magnetism. At Cambridge, I am working on Superconducting Spintronics with the group of Prof. [Chiara Ciccarelli](https://www.ciccarelli.phy.cam.ac.uk/).\\

Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. at IIT Delhi, India. During my Ph.D. I worked with the group of Prof. [Dhiman Mallick](https://sites.google.com/site/dhimanmallick) where I worked on Magnetoelectric based spintronic devices.  

\\Please see [Research interests](https://pathakpankaj7.github.io/portfolio/) section for more details.
