Thank you for visiting. I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Cavendish Laboratory](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge. My research is primarly focused on spintronics and magnetism. At Cambridge, I am working on Superconducting Spintronics with the group of Prof. [Chiara Ciccarelli](https://www.ciccarelli.phy.cam.ac.uk/). 

Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. at IIT Delhi, India, under the guidance of Prof. [Dhiman Mallick](https://sites.google.com/site/dhimanmallick). My doctoral research was centered on magnetoelectric-based spintronic and Lab-on-a-chip devices.
