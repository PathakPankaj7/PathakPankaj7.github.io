Welcome to my digital space. I am a Ph.D. candidate in [IEC Group](http://iec.iitd.ernet.in/) of Electrical Engineering department at [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi](https://www.iitd.ac.in/), working in the [Interdisciplinary Microsystems Lab (IML)](https://sites.google.com/site/dhimanmallick) led by [Prof. Dhiman Mallick](https://ee.iitd.ac.in/faculty-profile/49). Before that, I pursued my master's degree in [VLSI Design](https://www.nita.ac.in/Department/Deptindex.aspx?page=a&ItemID=ok&nDeptID=caase) at the [National Institute of Technology (NIT) Agartala](https://www.nita.ac.in/Department/Deptindex.aspx?page=a&ItemID=ok&nDeptID=caase). During that time, I had the opportunity to work under the guidance of [Prof. Kamalesh Debnath](https://www.nita.ac.in/Department/Department_FacultyProfile.aspx?nID=caici&nDeptID=caase) and [Prof. Suvra Prakash Mondal](https://sites.google.com/view/spmondalresearchgroup/home). I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering from [THDC-IHET](https://thdcihet.ac.in/).

My current research interest is primarily focused on magnetism and magnetoelectrics. Within this realm, I am exploring alternative routes to control magnetism in magnetoelectrics for advancing their multilevel approach; Their device applications from information technology to advanced biomedical applications; and Exploration of underlaying mechanisms to compliment the obtained experimental results using micromagnetic simulation platforms such as [MuMax3](https://mumax.github.io/) and [OOMMF](https://math.nist.gov/oommf/software.html) . To fabricate the magnetoelectric heterostructures, I have primarily used high vacuum sputtering system along with other micro fabrication techniques using clean room facilities at [Nanoscale Research Facility (NRF), IIT Delhi](https://nano.iitd.ac.in/). To test the fabricated magnetoelectrics, I have extensively used magnetotransport, Magnetoresistance, ferromagnetic Resonance, ferroelectric measurement and other parametric characterization techniques such as I-t measurements. Please see [Research interests](https://pathakpankaj7.github.io/portfolio/) section for more details.

I am also an active member of various professional organizations, including the [IEEE Magnetic Society](https://ieeemagnetics.org/), [IEEE Young Professionals](https://yp.ieee.org/), [Students in Magnetisms (SiM)](https://www.studentsinmagnetism.org/), [European Magnetism Association](https://magnetism.eu/85-ema.htm),and [American Physical Society](https://www.aps.org/).

Personal: I am incredibly fortunate to be married to Shivangi, an exceptionally talented artist whose stunning paintings adorn our home. Beyond her artistic prowess, Shivangi has a gift for writing enchanting poems and captivating short stories, many of which have been published. She currently excels as an assistant professor at Shubharti University, Meerut, India having impressively completed her Ph.D. ahead of me, even though she started after me. Our shared love for cats brings even more joy into our lives, with our two beloved feline companions, Odin and Dora, adding to the warmth and charm of our home. Every day with Shivangi and our furry friends is a beautiful blend of creativity, love, and inspiration.
