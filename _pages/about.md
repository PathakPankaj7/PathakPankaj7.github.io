Welcome to my digital space. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering department at [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi](https://www.iitd.ac.in/), working in the [Interdisciplinary Microsystems Lab (IML)](https://sites.google.com/site/dhimanmallick) led by [Prof. Dhiman Mallick](https://ee.iitd.ac.in/faculty-profile/49).

My research interest is primarily focused on magnetism and magnetoelectrics. Within this realm, I am exploring alternative routes to control magnetism in magnetoelectrics for advancing their multilevel approach; Their device applications from information technology to advanced biomedical applications; and Exploration of underlaying mechanisms using micromagnetic simulation platforms such as [MuMax3](https://mumax.github.io/) and [OOMMF](https://math.nist.gov/oommf/software.html) to compliment the obtained experimental results. To fabricate the magnetoelectric heterostructures, I have primarily used high vacuum sputtering system along with other micro fabrication techniques using clean room facilities at [Nanoscale Research Facility (NRF), IIT Delhi](https://nano.iitd.ac.in/). To test the fabricated magnetoelectrics, I have extensive used magnetotransport, Magnetoresistance, ferromagnetic Resonance, ferroelectric measurement and other parametric characterization techniques such as I-t measurements. Please see Research interest section for more details.

Outside of my research, I enjoy watching documentaries and anime for leisure and entertainment.
