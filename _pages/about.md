Thank you for visiting my website. 

<p>
  I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Cambridge, specializing in spintronics and magnetism. I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Delhi, where my research focused on magnetoelectric-based spintronic and Lab-on-a-Chip devices. Currently, I work in the <a href="https://www.ciccarelli.phy.cam.ac.uk/">Ciccarelli Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/">Cavendish Laboratory</a>, focusing on Superconducting Spintronics.
