Thank you for visiting my website. 

<p>
    I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Cambridge, specializing in spintronics and magnetism. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering under the supervision of 
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dhimanmallick/home">Prof. Dhiman Mallick</a> at 
    <a href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/">IIT Delhi</a>, where my research focused on magnetoelectric-based spintronic and Lab-on-a-Chip devices. 
    Currently, I am working with <a href="https://www.ciccarelli.phy.cam.ac.uk/">Prof. Chiara Ciccarelli</a> at the 
    <a href="https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/">Cavendish Laboratory</a>, focusing on superconducting spintronics.
