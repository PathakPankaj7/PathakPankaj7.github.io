welcome to my digital space. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering department at [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi](https://www.iitd.ac.in/), working in the [Interdisciplinary Microsystems Lab (IML)](https://sites.google.com/site/dhimanmallick) led by [Prof. Dhiman Mallick](https://ee.iitd.ac.in/faculty-profile/49).

My research endeavors revolve around the vast realms of magnetism and magnetoelectrics, with a specific focus on devising alternative avenues to manipulate magnetism within the magnetoelectric domain. This exploration extends to diverse device applications spanning information technology to advanced biomedical applications. To unravel the underlying mechanisms, I employ micromagnetic simulation platforms, complementing the insights gained from experimental results. In the creation of magnetoelectrics, I rely on a high vacuum sputtering system coupled with microfabrication techniques, utilizing the state-of-the-art clean room facilities at [Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Research Facility (NRF), IIT Delhi](https://nano.iitd.ac.in/). For testing of the fabricated magnetoelectrics I have used range of techniques, including magnetotransport, magnetoresistance, ferromagnetic resonance, ferroelectric measurements, and other parametric characterizations like I-t measurements. For a deeper understanding, explore the Research Interest section for comprehensive details.
