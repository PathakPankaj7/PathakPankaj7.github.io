Thank you for visiting. I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. at IIT Delhi, India.
My current research at Cambridge focuses on Superconducting Spintronics, where I am working with the group of Prof. Chiara Ciccarelli. Please see [Research interests](https://pathakpankaj7.github.io/portfolio/) section for more details.
