Welcome to my digital space. I am a Ph.D. candidate in [IEC Group](http://iec.iitd.ernet.in/) of Electrical Engineering department at [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi](https://www.iitd.ac.in/), working in the [Interdisciplinary Microsystems Lab (IML)](https://sites.google.com/site/dhimanmallick) led by [Prof. Dhiman Mallick](https://ee.iitd.ac.in/faculty-profile/49). Before that, I pursued my master's degree in VLSI Design at the [National Institute of Technology (NIT) Agartala](https://www.nita.ac.in/Department/Deptindex.aspx?page=a&ItemID=ok&nDeptID=caase). During that time, I had the opportunity to work under the guidance of [Prof. Kamalesh Debnath](https://www.nita.ac.in/Department/Department_FacultyProfile.aspx?nID=caici&nDeptID=caase) and [Prof. Suvra Prakash Mondal](https://sites.google.com/view/spmondalresearchgroup/home). I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering from [THDC-IHET](https://thdcihet.ac.in/).

My current research interest is primarily focused on magnetism and magnetoelectrics. Within this realm, I am exploring alternative routes to control magnetism in magnetoelectrics for advancing their multilevel approach; Their device applications from information technology to advanced biomedical applications; and Exploration of underlaying mechanisms to compliment the obtained experimental results using micromagnetic simulation platforms such as [MuMax3](https://mumax.github.io/) and [OOMMF](https://math.nist.gov/oommf/software.html) . To fabricate the magnetoelectric heterostructures, I have primarily used high vacuum sputtering system along with other micro fabrication techniques using clean room facilities at [Nanoscale Research Facility (NRF), IIT Delhi](https://nano.iitd.ac.in/). To test the fabricated magnetoelectrics, I have extensively used magnetotransport, Magnetoresistance, ferromagnetic Resonance, ferroelectric measurement and other parametric characterization techniques such as I-t measurements. Please see [Research interests](https://pathakpankaj7.github.io/portfolio/) section for more details.

I am also an active member of various professional organizations, including the [IEEE Magnetic Society](https://ieeemagnetics.org/), [IEEE Young Professionals](https://yp.ieee.org/), [Students in Magnetisms (SiM)](https://www.studentsinmagnetism.org/), and the [American Physical Society](https://www.aps.org/).

Outside of my research, I enjoy watching documentaries mostly related to history, politics and economics.
